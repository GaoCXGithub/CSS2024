    "In machine learning, accuracy isn't the only metric that we might care about. Accuracy is an expression of ratio of correct observations relative to incorrect observations. This calculation alone does not tell us much about whether we did a good job predicting all of the various categories that we might be concerned about. Consider our census dataset. We saw earlier that the target data is not equally distributed - there were far more people with \"<=50k\" income. As we saw in our confusion matrices, our algorithms tended to predict observations belonging to the \"<=50k\" category remarkably well, but tended to do much worse with the \">50k\" category. Why do you think this might be the case?"

    "Imagine we were primarily interested in detecting whether someone is \">50k\". We'll call this the \"positive\" class. A \"predicted\" observation is the value the model predicted, while the \"observed\" observation is the value in the ground-truth labels. So a \"true positive\" in this case would be instances when the model predicted someone to be in the \">50k\" category AND they were in the \">50k\" category in reality. Similarly, a false positive would be instances where the model predicted someone was in the \">50k\" category when they were actually in the \"<=50k\" category in reality. Use your best model from hyperparameter to predict on the validation set and see how you did on each of these metrics. **Hint**: The confusion matrix is actually a great way to visualize all of these. What does each quadrant of the matrix correspond to in terms of these metrics?"

    "These metrics matter in the social sciences because we usually are not given balanced datasets, and we are oftentimes concerned with predicting rare events. Predicting rare events like fraud, credit defaults, and mortality is difficult. Optimizing on accuracy alone can be misleading if the algorithm just guesses the majority class every time without ever predicting the outcome of interest. Next week we will delve even deeper into these concepts."
