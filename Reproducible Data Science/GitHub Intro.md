# Introduction to GitHub

Throughout this course, we'll be using a platform called [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub is a popular code hosting platform. It has lots of features that make version control and collaboration easier. Version control refers to the techniques for managing changes to software and code, and easily going back and forth between older and new versions of a code base. Getting familiar with GitHub and all of its tools can take some time, but the benefits for open science and streamlined collaboration are worth it.

At some point in your career, you have probably found yourself in a situation like this:

GitHub is a useful tool because it removes a lot of the obstacles that we usually face when we are collaborating with others. Instead of saving multiple versions of the same document, GitHub lets us iterate on the same document while recording how it has changed over time. Rather than sending collaborators messily named documents, everyone can work from the same GitHub repository. GitHub also has tools for resolving editing conflicts between collaborators and creating a clear workflow.

# Getting Started

First, let's get started by making GitHub accounts. Navigate to GitHub's [homepage](https://github.com). Navigate to "Sign Up" in the top right hand side of the page. I recommend you create an account using your berkeley.edu account.

After today's lab, I recommend you head over to GitHub Education and follow the instructions for activating your [free student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers). The student developer pack is free for as long as you are a student, and offers several benefits. The most important one of these will be GitHub Pro which gives you access to more collaboration tools and the ability to make unlimited private repositories. You might also consider exploring some of the other benefits like access to cloud services like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. 

# Navigating GitHub

## Interacting with Other Repos

GitHub is built on top of [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), which is a Linux-based version-control system. Git is used by software engineers and data scientists to track changes in code and other files, work together, and support distributed workflows. GitHub builds on top of the core toolkit by providing a suite of tools and graphical interfaces that streamline collaboration and code organization. Let's take a look at some of the features on the webpage. The first thing we will look at is how to interact with other users' repositories. Follow along by navigating to the GitHub repo for the [Computational Social Science](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program) course. 

![Interact With Repos](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program/blob/master/images/repo%20interaction.png)

There are three basic ways you can interact with someone else's repo:

- **Watch**: Notify you when there are changes or conversations in the repo.
- **Star**: Add this repo to a list of repos that appear in your feed. Think of this as "favoriting" a repo.
- **Fork**: Make a copy of this repository in your own account. This is useful if you are not directly involved with a project but want to build on top of someone else's code.

GitHub can be a great resource because it provides access to the world's largest collection of source code, and it hosts many open source projects. Depending on your field, there may already be lots of repositories available that are worth exploring. Try to do the following steps:

1. Find the search bar in the top left.
2. Search for repositories based on some key words that are common for your field. For example, try searching "public health" or "economics."
3. Star and/or fork a repository that you find.

You can also follow specific users to see all of the repositories associated with them. This is a great way to see what others are working on and keep up to date with new developments. For example, try navigating to [Aniket's page](https://github.com/akesari12/) page and following it. 

## Create Your Own Repo

Next, let's look at how to make your own repos. Over time, you will create new repos to host code for your projects and collaborations. Doing so will help others reproduce your code, and serve as a useful way to showcase your work to employers and other social scientists. From the GitHub homepage, look for the "New" button near the top left.

![New Repo](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program/blob/master/images/github%20new%20repo.png)

Once you do this, click the green button, then name your new repository "My First Repository" or whatever else you like. Make sure you click the box to initialize it with a README.

# Git from Command Line

## Configure credentials

Now we will see how to use some of git's core functions to work with repos and use version control. First, make sure to configure your global options for GitHub so that you don't have to login every time you want to do something. Open a bash terminal and do the following (substitute your GitHub handle and username):

```
git config --global user.name "Your Username"
git config --global user.email "your.email@berkeley.edu"
```

Then to make sure you only need to type in your password once, run the following:

```
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

The next time you try to interact with a git repo from the command line (as we'll do momentarily), you'll be asked to type in your username and password. After doing this once, you shouldn't have to do so again.

## Basic Workflow

First, we'll go through working with your own repository on your own. Some key terms:

- **Clone**: Download and copy a remote directory to a newly created folder on your machine. 
- **Add**: Stage changes you made to different files to get them ready to be uploaded back to the remote repository.
- **Commit**: Add a message to describe the changes that you have made.
- **Push**: Upload your changes.

Let's start by cloning the repository that you just created. Navigate to your repo's page, and find the green "Code" button.

![Initialize New Repo](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program/blob/master/images/clone%20button.png) 

Click the button, and then copy the HTML link that is displayed. Then run the following code in your terminal (substitute your link for the one here):

```
git clone https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program.git
```

Running this command in your terminal should create a folder in your current directory with the contents of your repo. Now let's practice adding content and updating the repo. Open the README.md file and add a short description of the repo (you can do this either from command line or your favorite text editor). Save the changes in the file, and then get ready to make the changes in the repository. First enter the following command:

```
git add README.md
```

OR

```
git add *
```

You can either add individual files, or add all of the files that you have changed at once with the "\*". When working with others or on complex projects, it is generally good practice to not add all files at once.

Next add a commit message describing the changes that you made. Try to make these descriptions as meaningful as possible. Every programmer is guilt of doing something like this:

![Commit Messages](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program/blob/master/images/git%commit.png) 

But in general, the more meaningful your commit messages and documentation, the easier it will be for you and your collaborators to revisit the code later! Try running the following code:

```
git commit -m "My first git commit message"
```

Now we're ready to make our final changes! Run the following code:

```
git push
```

This will upload your changes, and if you navigate back to your repository, you should see the changes reflected there.
