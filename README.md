# Computational-Social-Science-Labs

This repo contains all of the materials for Sociology 273, Computational Social Science Parts A/B. Designed as part of Berkeley's [Computational Social Science Training Program](https://bids.berkeley.edu/research/computational-social-science-training-program#:~:text=The%20UC%20Berkeley%20Computational%20Social,%2C%20social%20welfare%2C%20and%20sociology.) This course is a rigorous, yearlong introduction to computational social science. The target audience is 2nd year and beyond PhD students who have completed their home departments' introductory statistics courses. We cover topics spanning reproducibility and collaboration, machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference. This course has a strong applied focus with emphasis placed on *doing* computational social science. It makes extensive use of simulations, functional programming, and visualizations to illustrate statistical concepts and demonstrate how "computational social science" is a framework to think about how to analyze big data. By the end of the course, students will be well acquainted with some of the latest research and advanced in computational social science research, and begin working on their own projects.

Most modules contains both a "student" version and a "solutions" version. These are substantially the same, with the difference being that the student versions leave some code lines partially blank for in-class challenges. Each project is designed for groups of 3-4 students who use GitHub to collaborate and version control code. Several popular data science libraries are used frequently including `sklearn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `spaCy`, `gensim`, `tidyverse`, `tidymodels`, and `SuperLearner`. For the most part the latest versions for any of these libraries should work, with exceptions noted in the notebooks as necessary.
